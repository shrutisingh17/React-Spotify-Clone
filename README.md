# React-Spotify-Clone
This repository contains a front-end clone of the Spotify web player and a backend authentication server. The front-end app uses the Spotify API to provide users with access to playlists, albums, artists, and user profiles. The authentication server handles the authorization and authentication process for the Spotify clone app.
