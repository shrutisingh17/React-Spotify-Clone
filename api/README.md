## Spotify Clone App Authentication Server

The Spotify Clone App Authentication Server is responsible for handling the authorization and authentication process for the Spotify clone app.

## Tech/Framework Used
Node.js
Express.js
Axios
Spotify Web API

## Authorization Code Flow

The majority of the code flow is similar to the authorization code flow outlined in the Spotify API documentation. The data returned at step 2 is the access token as JSON, which is stored in memory on the client-side (the client will now show the logged-in version of the app).

##
To run the server, use the npm run dev command.
